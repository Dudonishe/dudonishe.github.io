			"Why Are You Gay?", sometimes spelled "Why Are You Gae?", is a memorable quote from a debate on homosexuality aired by the Ugandan TV channel NBS TV in 2012. Initially circulated as a viral video, in 2019 the fragment of the broadcast, along with several other memorable scenes, were used in remixes and as image macros.

				On December 18th, 2012, an episode of English-language morning show Morning Breeze aired on Ugandan TV channel NBS TV. In the episode, transgender LGBT rights activist Pepe Julian Onziema debated with Morning Breeze host Simon Kaggwa Njala and pastor Martin Ssempa on homosexuality. On December 20th, 2012, YouTube[1] user Swalz uploaded the broadcast to the platform. The video accumulated over 410,000 views in six years.
				In the first few minutes of the interview, host Simon Kagwa Njala addresses the guest with a question "why are you gay?"
				- We bring in the studio this morning one of the gay right activists, mister – should I call you "mister"? (Sure) – Pepe Julian Onzima. Thank you for coming in, good morning. Why are you gay?
				- Who says I'm gay?
				- You are gay
